# Homework 8
## Overview
Submit a Jupyter notebook on Canvas exploring the dataset (or one of the datasets) for your project using pandas or scikit-learn/Keras or Altair.  (Those correspond to 3 of the **rubric items** for the final project.  You should just focus on one of these three rubric items for this homework, although of course it's fine to also use other libraries as well.)

Getting full points on this homework means we estimate you would get full 4/4 points for this rubric item.

## Details
Here are more details about this homework.
1.  Overall goal: explore the dataset for your project using pandas or scikit-learn/Keras or Altair.
1.  Each student should submit their own assignment.
1.  State at the top which rubric item you are focusing on in this homework: pandas or scikit-learn/Keras or Altair.
1.  Include a link to the dataset. (If the dataset is not public, you can put it on GitHub or Google Drive and share a link.  You don't need to upload the dataset.)
1.  Include MarkDown cells to help the reader understand what you're doing.
1.  Reference everything, just like you will on the final project.  Ask on Ed Discussion if you're not sure whether to reference something.
1.  This homework submission should be a `.ipynb` file, unlike the final project which will be a Streamlit app.
1.  Make sure to include the output cells in the submission.  That way we can tell what you did without downloading the dataset ourselves. (The output cells should be included automatically; you don't need to do anything special to include them.)
