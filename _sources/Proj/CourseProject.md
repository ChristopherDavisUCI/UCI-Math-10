# Course Project
Not yet finalized.  Last updated Friday, November 5th.
## Introduction
The goal of the course project is to design and share a data-focused Streamlit app.
## Logistics
The following are requirements to receive a passing score on the course project.
* Due date: Monday, December 6th 2021, 3:30pm California time.
* For the submission, give a link to the app on Streamlit.
* This is an individual project (not a group project).
* Share the app using GitHub and Streamlit cloud (Community tier).  The code should be  viewable on GitHub.
* The primary focus of the app must be on something involving data, and primarily using one or more datasets that weren't covered in Math 10.
* The project should clearly build on the Math 10 material.  If you're an expert in Python material that was not covered in Math 10, you are of course welcome to use that, but the project should use the topics of Math 10 in an essential way (see the rubric below).
* Anything that is taken from another source (either the idea for the project or a piece of code that is longer than a few lines) should be referenced with a link, both in the source code and in the final Streamlit app.  (One way to do this is to have a **References** section at the bottom of your app.  Then the references should be of the form "This portion of the app was taken from \[link\]").
## Rubric
The course project is worth 25% of your course grade, so we will grade the project out of 25 points.
1. (5 points) Is the project clear and well-organized?  Does it explore one or more clearly described datasets, and include links specifying where those datasets came from?  Use text throughout the project to help the reader understand what is going on.  Is the reasoning clear? (It's fine if you have negative results like, "so there is no clear connection between these variables".  In fact, those sorts of results are better than over-stated claims.)
1. (4 points) Does the project make essential use of pandas to explore the data?  Using pandas to read and store the data is not sufficient.  It should also be used either to clean the data, or to analyze the data.
1. (4 points) Does the project explore the data using scikit-learn or Keras? 
1. (4 points) Does the project include interesting charts from Altair?
1. (4 points) Does the project include interactivity, made possible through the use of multiple different Streamlit widgets?
1. (4 points) Does the project include material that was not covered in Math 10?  This could include different libraries, different machine learning algorithms, or deeper use of the libraries we covered in Math 10.
## Frequently asked questions
Is there a length requirement?
* There is no specific length requirement, but as a rough estimate, spending approximately 20 productive hours on the project would be a good amount.

What should I focus on?
* The primary content should be from one or more of the Math 10 tools (NumPy, pandas, Altair, scikit-learn, Keras, Streamlit).  If you like Streamlit much more than pandas, for example, then it's okay to go more in-depth in the use of Streamlit, and less in-depth in the use of pandas.

Do I need to get original research results?
* No!  If you explore the data in an interesting way, but can't find any interesting conclusions, that's fine.  In fact, I prefer that to making claims that the data does not support.
