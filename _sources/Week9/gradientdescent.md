# Gradient Descent

## Recommended resources

Here are some recommended places to read about gradient descent.

* [Real Python article](https://realpython.com/gradient-descent-algorithm-python/). There are a handful of websites that come up over and over when you search for Python resources.  I consistently find the articles at Real Python to be very high quality, typically higher quality than the alternatives.

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning section](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#learning_with_gradient_descent).  This is where I learned about gradient descent.
