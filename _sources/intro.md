## Original source

I originally duplicated the University of Washington's [Visualization Curriculum](https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html).
I thank the authors for making this material available not just to use, but to edit via their [GitHub source code](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum).

## Current content

As of October 27th, 2021, the content from Weeks 1 and 2 is disorganized (it's mostly just the notebooks from lecture), but the content from Week 3 and beyond is more readable.


## Course-level Learning Outcomes

The goal of this course is to introduce programming in Python, with an emphasis on some of the tools that are most relevant to **data science**.  The primary learning outcomes for Math~10 are that students will be able to:
* select appropriate data types (both built-in Python types as well as types defined in external libraries) when performing computations;
* manipulate structured data using NumPy and pandas;
* display significant aspects of datasets using Altair;
* run machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn;
* improve the performance of various machine learning algorithms by adjusting parameters;
* evaluate simple neural networks by hand, and complex neural networks using Keras;
* apply tools from unfamiliar Python libraries using some combination of documentation, error messages, and code examples written by experienced programmers;
* create an interactive, data-focused web app using Streamlit.
