# UC Irvine, Math 10, Fall 2021

## Current content

Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content.  

As of October 27th, 2021, the content from Weeks 1 and 2 is disorganized (it's mostly just the notebooks from lecture), but the content from Week 3 and beyond is more readable.

## Original source

I originally duplicated the University of Washington's [Visualization Curriculum](https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html).
I thank the authors for making this material available not just to use, but to edit via their [GitHub source code](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum).
