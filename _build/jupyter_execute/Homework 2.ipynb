    "If $a$ and $b$ are integers, you can check if $a$ is divisible by $b$ by computing `a%b`.  If `a%b` is equal to 0, then $a$ is divisible by $b$, otherwise, $a$ is not divisible by $b$.  Write a function `is_prime` to check if an integer is prime, using the following strategy.  (Don't use a different strategy, even if your other strategy is better!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function should take one input.\n",
    "* Use the `isinstance` function to see if the input is an integer.  If it's not, return False.  (We haven't covered this function.  You can learn how it works by using help or ?.)\n",
    "* If the input is strictly less than 2, return False.\n",
    "* Using the `%` operator as described as above, check if the input is prime.  Return True if it's prime, return False otherwise.  (Reminder: an integer $p \\geq 2$ is prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$.)\n",
    "* Make sure what you are returning has type bool.  (A common beginning programming mistake is to print \"True\" or \"False\", or to return the string \"True\" or the string \"False\".  Neither of those is correct.  You should be returning the Python built-in object True or False with a capital letter and no quotation marks.)"
